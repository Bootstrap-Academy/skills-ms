# Bootstrap Academy Skills Microservice
The official skills microservice of [Bootstrap Academy](https://bootstrap.academy/).

If you would like to submit a bug report or feature request, or are looking for general information about the project or the publicly available instances, please refer to the [Bootstrap-Academy repository](https://github.com/Bootstrap-Academy/Bootstrap-Academy).

## Development Setup
1. Install [Python 3.11](https://python.org/), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and [poethepoet](https://pypi.org/project/poethepoet/).
2. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
3. Run `poe setup` to install the dependencies.
4. Start a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, for example using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/):
    ```bash
    podman run -d --rm \
        --name postgres \
        -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 \
        -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust \
        postgres:alpine
    ```
5. Create the `academy-skills` database:
    ```bash
    podman exec postgres \
        psql -U postgres \
        -c 'create database "academy-skills"'
    ```
6. Start a [Redis](https://redis.io/) instance, for example using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/):
    ```bash
    podman run -d --rm \
        --name redis \
        -p 127.0.0.1:6379:6379 \
        redis:alpine
    ```
7. Run `poe migrate` to run the database migrations.
8. Run `poe api` to start the microservice. You can find the automatically generated swagger documentation on http://localhost:8001/docs.

## Poetry Scripts
```bash
poe setup           # setup dependencies, .env file and pre-commit hook
poe api             # start api locally
poe test            # run unit tests
poe pre-commit      # run pre-commit checks
  poe lint          # run linter
    poe format      # run auto formatter
      poe isort     # sort imports
      poe black     # reformat code
    poe ruff        # check code style
    poe mypy        # check typing
    poe flake8      # check code style
  poe coverage      # run unit tests with coverage
poe alembic         # use alembic to manage database migrations
poe migrate         # run database migrations
poe env             # show settings from .env file
poe jwt             # generate a jwt with the given payload and ttl in seconds
poe check           # check course definitions
poe sync_skills     # push local skills to backend (deprecated)
poe sweep-deleted-users  # delete the data of users the auth service no longer knows
```

## Account Deletion
When an account is deleted, the auth service calls `DELETE /_internal/users/{user_id}` on this microservice.
The endpoint requires an internal token with the `skills` audience, deletes every row that belongs to the user (course access, last watch, lecture progress, sub skill bookmarks and XP), drops the cache entries keyed on a user id, and answers `204` — also for a user that has no data here, so it can be retried safely.

Because the auth service logs and swallows a failing call, a periodic sweep catches the deletions that were lost:

```bash
poe sweep-deleted-users
```

It walks the distinct user ids in those tables in batches, asks the auth service for each one and deletes the data of every user it answers `404` for.
The relevant settings are:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AUTH_URL` | `""` | Base url of the auth service the sweep asks whether a user still exists. |
| `INTERNAL_JWT_TTL` | `10` | Lifetime in seconds of the token used for those requests. |
| `DELETED_USER_SWEEP_BATCH_SIZE` | `500` | Number of user ids loaded from the database per batch. |
| `DELETED_USER_SWEEP_RATE_LIMIT` | `10` | Auth service requests per second. Set to `0` to disable the delay. |

In the NixOS module the sweep is a oneshot service with a timer, enabled through `academy.backend.skills.sweepDeletedUsers.enable` (`interval`, default `daily`, and `randomizedDelay`, default `5m`).

## PyCharm configuration
Configure the Python interpreter:

- Open PyCharm and go to `Settings` ➔ `Project` ➔ `Python Interpreter`
- Open the menu `Python Interpreter` and click on `Show All...`
- Click on the plus symbol
- Click on `Poetry Environment`
- Select `Existing environment` (setup the environment first by running `poe setup`)
- Confirm with `OK`

Setup the run configuration:

- Click on `Add Configuration...` ➔ `Add new...` ➔ `Python`
- Change target from `Script path` to `Module name` and choose the `api` module
- Change the working directory to root path  ➔ `Edit Configurations`  ➔ `Working directory`
- In the `EnvFile` tab add your `.env` file
- Confirm with `OK`
